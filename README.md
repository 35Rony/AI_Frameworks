- **Description:** Includes convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Usage:** Scripts for dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Deployment:** Interactive web app using Streamlit or Flask included.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) on Product Reviews
- **Purpose:** Extract named entities like product names and brands from customer reviews.
- **Technology:** SpaCy NLP library.
- **Description:** Customizable NER pipeline trained or fine-tuned on product reviews.
- **Application:** Enables structured data extraction for downstream analysis.

### 3. Rule-Based Sentiment Analysis on Reviews
- **Purpose:** Classify sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative) in reviews.
- **Approach:** Keyword-based rule system complementing the NER pipeline.
- **Utility:** Rapid sentiment assessment without deep learning overhead.
